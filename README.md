We have the following output convention:

For the point added outside the triangle, we will just ignore it.
For the point lined on one edge of the triangle, we will still label the point.
For the command to construct a triangle whose three vertices lie on the same line, we will ignore it.


p.s.
The input file should put inside debug folder.
We have use keyboard control to change the view of the graph.
